# Milestone 1: **STM32 Familiarization**

## Overview

The purpose of this milestone is to familiarize with STM32 firmware development and learn on verification of the STM32 board by creating and running Blinky program which blinks the LED at 1Hz. And by the end, students are also able to learn on reporting using Github and the use of markdown code.

The STM32 Nucleo-64 is used for this project in which the device is based on high-performance Arm® Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 100 MHz. It incorporates high-speed embedded memories which is up to 512 Kbytes of Flash memory and 128 Kbytes of SRAM. The STM32 Nucleo-64 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.

There are a few steps done on order to complete this project milestone. Firstly, the STM32Cube IDE was installed onto the PC. Then a USB cable was used to connect the board to the PC. Next, the Blinky program was created and then the program was developed onto the board. By running the program, students are able to get the observed and verified the results obtained.

## Source code

_The source is generated in C language:_ [Source code](main.c)

Two lines was added to the code generated by the STM32 IDE tool. The first line is to toggle the Port A, Pin 5 which is connected to the green LED, LD2 of the nucleo board and the other line is to set the delay to 1000 ms.
